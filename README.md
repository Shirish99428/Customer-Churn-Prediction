# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn in a telecom company. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, companies can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Dataset
The analysis uses a telecom customer dataset containing various features such as:
- Customer demographics
- Service usage patterns
- Billing information
- Contract details

## Methodology
The project follows a comprehensive data science workflow:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Initial examination of the dataset structure
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing churn distribution and identifying correlations
4. **Feature Engineering**: Preparing data for modeling
5. **Model Implementation**: Training and tuning multiple classification models
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various metrics
7. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifying key factors influencing customer churn

## Results
- The models achieve high accuracy in predicting customer churn
- Key factors influencing churn are identified and visualized
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics are provided for each model

## Visualizations
The project generates several visualizations:
- Churn distribution
- Correlation matrix
- Confusion matrices for each model
- ROC curves
- Feature importance charts
- Model comparison

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python telecom_customer_churn.py`

## Future Work
- Deploy the model in a production environment
- Create an interactive dashboard for visualization
- Implement targeted retention strategies
- Monitor model performance and retrain periodically
